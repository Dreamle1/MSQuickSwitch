# WinQuickSwitch

WinQuickSwitch is a small Windows 11 utility for reaching common display,
audio, microphone, Bluetooth, and wired-device controls without digging through
Settings.

This repository contains the product plan, technical design, and the first
functional slice. The four projection-mode controls are wired to Windows;
audio and device work remains planned.

## Planned first release

- Switch projection mode: PC screen only, duplicate, extend, or second screen
  only (the actions behind `Win + P`).
- View active per-application audio sessions and change their volume or mute
  state.
- View and choose speaker/headphone and microphone endpoints.
- List connected Bluetooth and locally wired devices, with connection and
  enabled-state information when Windows exposes it.
- Run as an ordinary user and stay closed when not needed; no background
  service, account, telemetry, or network access.

The detailed scope and milestones are in
[docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md](docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md). Technical boundaries and API
choices are in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Technology

- C# and WPF
- .NET 10 LTS
- Windows 11, version 22H2 or newer
- Direct Windows APIs through small adapters
- No web view or Electron runtime

.NET 10 is used because it is the current active LTS release. A
framework-dependent build should be the default lightweight distribution;
single-file self-contained builds can be offered separately.

## Development setup

1. Install the .NET 10 SDK or Visual Studio 2026 with the .NET desktop
   development workload.
2. Confirm the SDK:

   ```powershell
   dotnet --info
   ```

3. Restore and build:

   ```powershell
   dotnet restore .\WinQuickSwitch.sln
   dotnet build .\WinQuickSwitch.sln
   ```

4. Run the application shell:

   ```powershell
   dotnet run --project .\src\WinQuickSwitch\WinQuickSwitch.csproj
   ```

5. Run the dependency-free automated tests:

   ```powershell
   dotnet run --project .\tests\WinQuickSwitch.Tests\WinQuickSwitch.Tests.csproj
   ```

A project-local SDK may also be installed in the ignored `.dotnet` directory.
The implementation and exact verification history are recorded in
[docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md).

## Project status

Display switching is implemented; capability/topology detection and attended
hardware checks remain before M1 is complete. Read-only audio endpoint and
session enumeration is the next feature slice.
